### Tech Stack:
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

### Type of Functional Testing Techniques
There are various types of functional testing which are as follows:

- **Unit Testing**
    Unit testing is the type of functional testing technique where the individual units or modules of the application are tested. It ensures that each module is working correctly.

    > *Tools : Selenium, BrowserStack*
    <!-- ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ÿ™ÿ≥ÿ™ ÿ≥ÿßÿ≤⁄Øÿßÿ±€å ŸÜÿ±ŸÖ‚ÄåÿßŸÅÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿØÿ± ŸÖÿ±Ÿàÿ±⁄Øÿ±Ÿáÿß Ÿà ÿØÿ≥ÿ™⁄ØÿßŸá‚ÄåŸáÿß€å ŸÖÿÆÿ™ŸÑŸÅ ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÅÿßÿØŸá ŸÖ€å ÿ¥ŸàÿØ -->
- **Endurance testing**
    is a type of testing to ensure that a software program or system can handle a long-term, continuous load. For example for the banking application, the application is tested to know if the system can sustain under the continuous expected load.
    > *Tools : Locust, Apache JMeter*
